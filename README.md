RiskPCOS: A Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) Risk Assessment

https://riskpcos-rcyygyizzwkw7pawagfz9m.streamlit.app/#riskpcos-a-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-risk-assessment

This app aims to predict PCOS diagnosis via risk assessment among fertile women and compare hormonal. metabolic, fertility, and lifestyle measures among infertile and fertile women with/without PCOS. Users can explore IDA and EDA across these categories to gain an understanding on how these variables are impacted by PCOS. In the future, users will interact with a nomogram created from a regression model to visualize how risk for PCOS changes depending on how variables change.

If you would like to run these files locally to this streamlit app, do the following:
