RiskPCOS: A Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) Risk Assessment

https://riskpcos-rcyygyizzwkw7pawagfz9m.streamlit.app/#riskpcos-a-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-risk-assessment

This app aims to predict PCOS diagnosis via risk assessment among fertile/infertile women and compare hormonal, metabolic, fertility, and lifestyle measures among infertile and fertile women with/without PCOS. Users can explore IDA/EDA across these categories to gain an understanding on how these variables are impacted by PCOS. Additionally, an interative PCA analysis was executed, allowing users to differ the PCs (minimum 2 PCs for matric plot, minimum 3 PCs for 3D plot). Furthermore, users can view the different machine learning algorithms and their performance to inform how the best model was chosen for accessing PCOS risk. Lastly, viewers are be able to interact with a nomogram created from a machine learning model to access percentage of risk for PCOS depending on how variables change.

If you would like to run these files locally for this streamlit app, do the following:

First, git clone this repo. Make sure to install libraries from requirements.txt, install streamlit via these instructions at https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/installation , create a python environment called 'streamlitenv', then run runStreamlit4Midterm.ipynb.
